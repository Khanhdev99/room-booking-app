# room-booking-app
A mobile room booking and management app built with React Native, Firebase, and Momo payment integration.
1. Project Introduction
The VMO Booking application is a mobile platform (Android & iOS) for booking and managing accommodations, aimed at providing users with a convenient, fast, and secure experience when searching, booking, and paying for various types of rooms.
The application is designed for both customers (room bookers) and property owners (room managers). Users can easily search for suitable rooms based on location, price, and amenities, while property owners can manage room information, booking schedules, and revenue directly through the app.

Develop a product similar to Booking.com but focused on the Vietnamese market.


Optimize a user-friendly interface, supporting both Vietnamese and English languages.


Integrate Momo payment to match the habits of Vietnamese users.
